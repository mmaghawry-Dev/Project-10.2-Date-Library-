# 🗓️ Date Library (C++)

This project is a **Date Library** built in C++ to practice and apply advanced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, constructors, polymorphism, and clean code principles.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to **apply and demonstrate OOP principles** learned throughout the course — including real-world use of:
- **Abstraction & Encapsulation**
- **Constructors & Copy Constructors**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Static Methods**
- **Function Overloading**
- **Property Getters & Setters**
- **Clean Code practices**

---

## ⚙️ Features

This library provides various date-related operations such as:

- `DaysUntilTheEndOfMonth()` – Calculates how many days are left until the end of the current month.  
- `CalculateVacationDays()` – Estimates total vacation days based on start and end dates.  
- `CalculateVacationReturnDate()` – Returns the date of return from vacation.  
- `CalculateMyAgeInDays()` – Calculates a person’s age in days.  
- `GetDifferenceInDays()` – Finds the number of days between two dates.  
- `AddOneDay()` – Adds one day to a given date.  
- `IsDate1BeforeDate2()` – Compares two dates to check which comes first.  
- `DaysFromTheBeginingOfTheYear()` – Counts how many days have passed since the start of the year.  
- `DateToString()` – Converts a date into a readable string format.  
- `NumberOfDaysInAYear()` – Returns the number of days in a given year (leap year check).  
- `DayOfWeekOrder()` – Determines which day of the week a date falls on.  
- `PrintYearCalender()` – Prints a full calendar of the year.
  
 * and more operations.

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Abstraction & Encapsulation** | Organized data and behavior into a clean `Date` class structure. |
| **Constructor & Copy Constructor** | For creating and duplicating date objects safely. |
| **Polymorphism** | Used for flexible behavior between date operations. |
| **Static Methods** | For utility functions that do not depend on specific instances. |
| **Function Overloading** | For multiple ways to calculate or compare dates. |
| **Getters & Setters** | To safely access and modify private data members. |
| **Clean Code** | Structured, readable, and maintainable code with clear function naming and separation of concerns. |

## 🧩 Purpose

This project was developed as a **practical application of OOP concepts** taught in my programming course.  
It combines theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation, following clean coding standards.
